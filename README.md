# Trend Scalp Pro

Trend Scalp Pro is a trading algorithm developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to automate the decision-making process using technical analysis techniques and implement multiple trading strategies based on favorable market conditions. This code provides a sample implementation of the Trend Scalp Pro algorithm.

## How It Works

The Trend Scalp Pro algorithm consists of several custom functions that work together to execute trades based on trend confirmation, calculate trend points, implement trading strategies, filter unfavorable market conditions, automate decision-making using technical analysis, and provide live monitoring capability.

### IsTrendConfirmed Function

This function checks for trend confirmation based on the Super Trend Line indicator and three price levels. It calculates the upper and lower levels of the Super Trend Line indicator based on the current price. If the price is above all three price levels and below the Super Trend Line upper level, or if the price is below all three price levels and above the Super Trend Line lower level, the function returns true, indicating trend confirmation.

### CalculateTrendPoints Function

This function calculates the lowest and highest points for drawing trend lines. The actual calculations are not provided in the code and should be implemented based on historical data. In this sample code, the lowest point is set to 1.2000 and the highest point is set to 1.4000 as placeholders.

### ExecuteTrades Function

This function executes trades based on the current price and the calculated lowest and highest points. It retrieves the open price of the current position and the current bid price. If the current price is above the highest point and the open price is below the highest point, a buy trade is executed. If the current price is below the lowest point and the open price is above the lowest point, a sell trade is executed.

### ImplementTradingStrategies Function

This function is responsible for implementing different trading strategies based on the risk appetite. The actual trading strategies are not provided in the code and should be implemented based on the desired trading approach.

### IsMarketConditionFavorable Function

This function filters unfavorable market conditions. The actual market condition filters are not provided in the code and should be implemented based on the desired criteria.

### AutomateDecisionMaking Function

This function performs technical analysis to automate the decision-making process. The actual technical analysis techniques are not provided in the code and should be implemented based on the desired analysis tools and indicators. If the market condition is favorable, the function calls the ImplementTradingStrategies function to execute trades.

### MonitorMarket Function

This function provides live monitoring capability. The actual implementation of live monitoring is not provided in the code and should be implemented based on the desired monitoring tools and indicators.

### ExecuteAlgorithm Function

This function is the main algorithm that runs continuously. It calls the MonitorMarket function to monitor the market, the AutomateDecisionMaking function to automate the decision-making process, and introduces a 1-second delay between iterations using the Sleep function.
